## Code Examples

### Backend Route Example
The backend routes are defined using **Express.js**, where middleware is used for validation and controllers manage the business logic.

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { login, signup, logout } from "../controllers/user/user.auth.controller.js";
import { validate } from "../middlewares/validation.middleware.js";
import { loginSchema } from "../validation/users.auth.validation.js";

const router = express.Router();

// Authentication Routes
router.post("/access/user/login", validate(loginSchema, "body"), login);
router.post("/access/user/signup", signup);
router.post("/access/user/logout", logout);
// Further continuation 
export default router;
```

### Backend Controller Example
This controller handles user login with validations, error handling, and status management.

```javascript
export const login = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { username, password } = req.body;

    const currentUser = await User.findOne({ username });
    if (!currentUser) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: "User not found." });
    }

    if (currentUser.password !== password) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid password." });
    }

    // Check user type and status
    const allowedTypes = ["Seller", "Advertiser", "Tour Guide"];
    if (allowedTypes.includes(currentUser.type) && currentUser.status !== "Accepted") {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: "Your account is not approved for login." });
    }

    console.log(currentUser);

    res.status(200).json({ message: "Login successful", user: currentUser });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Server error", error: err.message });
  }
};
```
### Backend Model Example
This example demonstrates how the model's schema was created and intialized. We will take at the user Model. 
```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  }, // Password of the user
  type: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["Tourist", "Tour Guide", "Admin", "Seller", "Tourism Governor", "Advertiser"], // Possible user roles
    required: true,
  },
  hasAcceptedTerms: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false, // Default to false, indicating they haven't accepted yet
  },
  joinDate: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now, // Automatically sets the current date and time when the user is created
  },
  firstLogin: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: true,
  },
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
export default User;
```
### Frontend Profile Page Example
This example demonstrates how the user's profile is initialized in the frontend, using React with hooks for state and effects.

```javascript
const TouristProfile = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const userId = getUserId();
  const [userProfile, setUserProfile] = useState(null);
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const [redeemSuccess, setRedeemSuccess] = useState(false);
  const [profilePicUrl, setProfilePicUrl] = useState("");
  const [vacationOptions, setVacationOptions] = useState([]);
  const [addresses, setAddresses] = useState([]);
  const [loadingAddresses, setLoadingAddresses] = useState(true);

  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    username: "",
    email: "",
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    phoneNumber: "",
    nationality: "",
    birthDate: "",
    occupation: "",
    gender: "",
    currency: "",
    preferences: [],
  });

  const countries = [
    "USA", "Canada", "UK", "Germany", "France", "Australia", "Egypt", "Italy", 
    "Spain", "Brazil", "Argentina", "Mexico", "India", "China", "Japan", 
    "South Korea", "Saudi Arabia", "United Arab Emirates"
  ];

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProfile = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await getProfile(userId);
        const fullName = response.data.userProfile.name.split(" ");

        setUserProfile(response.data.userProfile);
        setFormData({
          username: response.data.userProfile.username,
          email: response.data.userProfile.email,
          firstName: fullName[0],
          lastName: fullName[1] || "",
          phoneNumber: response.data.userProfile.phoneNumber,
          nationality: response.data.userProfile.nationality,
          birthDate: response.data.userProfile.birthDate,
          occupation: response.data.userProfile.occupation,
          currency: response.data.userProfile.currency || "",
          gender: response.data.userProfile.gender || "",
          preferences: response.data.userProfile.preferences || [],
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching profile:", error);
      }
    };
    fetchProfile();
  }, [userId]);
};
// Further continuation 
```

### Frontend Service Example
This example shows how to handle file uploads in the frontend, using Axios to call the backend API.

```javascript
export const uploadFiles = async (formData) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:8000/user/upload/documents", formData, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data" },
    });
    return response.data; // Return the response data from the API
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("File upload failed:", error);
    throw error; // Rethrow the error to handle it in the calling function
  }
};
```

## Testing

In this project, we employed a comprehensive approach to testing, covering both backend functionality and frontend rendering.

### Backend Testing with Postman

For backend testing, we used **Postman** to validate the functionality of the API routes. Postman allowed us to test various endpoints by sending HTTP requests and analyzing the responses. This helped ensure that the routes were functioning correctly, returning the expected results, and handling edge cases as anticipated.

We used Postman to:
- **Send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests**: We tested different HTTP methods to ensure that the API routes worked as expected for different use cases.
- **Verify status codes**: We confirmed that the correct HTTP status codes were returned for success, errors, and edge cases.
- **Check response data**: We validated that the returned data matched the expected structure, including correct data types and values.
- **Test authentication and authorization**: We tested the required headers, tokens, and authorization checks to ensure secure access to protected routes.

![alt text](<WhatsApp Image 2024-12-09 at 3.05.42 AM (1).jpeg>) 
![alt text](<WhatsApp Image 2024-12-09 at 3.05.42 AM.jpeg>)

By using Postman, we were able to simulate real-world API requests and verify that the backend functions as intended before integration with the frontend.

### Frontend Testing with Visual Judgment

For frontend testing, we used **visual judgment** to verify that the components rendered correctly and as expected. This involved:
- **Checking the appearance and layout**: We manually tested how components rendered on different devices and screen sizes to ensure they were responsive and visually appealing.
- **Validating component state**: We visually confirmed that components updated correctly when the state or props changed, such as verifying that form inputs, buttons, and dynamic content were behaving as expected.
- **Testing interactivity**: We clicked through the application to ensure that user interactions, such as clicks and form submissions, triggered the correct actions and displayed the expected results.

### Debugging and Handling Incorrect Logic

When encountering issues with logic or rendering:
- **Strong Debugging Skills**: We utilized browser developer tools and console logging to track down bugs and errors in both the frontend and backend. By closely inspecting the flow of data and the behavior of functions, we could identify and resolve issues efficiently.
- **Test-Driven Debugging**: When logic errors were detected, we applied test-driven debugging techniques by isolating specific functions or components and stepping through their execution to identify and correct the faulty logic.
